IMVDB access for Colin

To use:

1. **departments.csv** - this is the list of all departments for all positions. Change to "1" to include a department in the search results. Change to "0" to exclude the entire department
2. **positions.csv** - these are all positions for all departments. It was compiled from the list at https://imvdb.com/browse/position as of June 2022
3. **positions.ignore.csv** - add any lines from positions.csv that you want excluded in the search results
4. The script is currently hosted on my website at http://www.dsa157.com/imvdb/imvdb.pl
